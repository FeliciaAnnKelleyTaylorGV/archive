Support for other developers (as explained in 2.2 of the proposal) will be
ongoing, to ensure that the number of open issues for SciPy statistics
remains below the baseline established at the start of the project.

The following table is our plan for the new features to be added to SciPy.
The schedule is based on a start date of December 2, 2019.

The Target Date is the date by which we will have submitted a feature-complete
pull request with the implementation, unit tests, benchmarks, and documentation.
We anticipate most pull requests will be merged within two weeks of the target
date, after review by other SciPy developers.  The merged pull requests are
the software deliverables for the project.

In any time remaining, we will continue to support other developers and
work on integrative tutorials (2.1).

The other deliverable for the project is the coding sprint with the WISH group
at Cal Poly (activity 3.3.7 in the proposal).  The sprint will take place in November;
the exact date will be arranged in September in conjunction with the club's leadership.
