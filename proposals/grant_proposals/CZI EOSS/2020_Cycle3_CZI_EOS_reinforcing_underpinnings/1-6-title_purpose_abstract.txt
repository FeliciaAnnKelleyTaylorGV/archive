a. Progress Report: Provide a short summary of progress towards the deliverables in your currently funded proposal.

Expand tools for the analysis of variance:
* Initial PR (gh-12630) has been drafted.

New statistical tests:
* Kendall's tau-c completed (gh-9361)
* Page's L (gh-12531) and Somers' D (gh-12653) tests are in review.

Improve Existing Tests:
PRs adding the following are in review.
* one-sided alternatives for t-tests (gh-12597) and Pearson's R (gh-12609)
* confidence intervals for Pearson's R (gh-12609), the binomial test (gh-12603), Fisher's exact test (gh-12288), and one-way ANOVA (gh-12630)
* conditional maximum likelihood odds ratio for Fisher's exact test (gh-12288)

Fitting Probability Distributions:
* A PR for the method of moments (gh-11695) is in review.
* Added analytical maximum likelihood estimates for the Laplace (gh-11988) and Pareto (gh-12457) distributions.
* PRs for the Rayleigh (gh-12097) and Inverse Gaussian (gh-12514) distributions are in review.

New Probability Distributions:
* Completed the negative hypergeometric distribution (gh-12170)
* A PR for the multivariate hypergeometric distribution (gh-12585) is in review.

Improve Underlying Code for PDF and CDF Calculations:
Nicholas McKibben has joined the project to wrap PDF and CDF calculations from Boost; he is currently working on the noncentral chi-squared distribution.

Support Other Developers:
Together, we have contributed to more than 240 issues that have closed since the project began.

Outreach Event:
Due to the pandemic, we will no longer be hosting the in-person event proposed in Cycle 1, but we will have a virtual mentored sprint for diverse beginners in the fall.

4. Proposal Purpose
Limit to one sentence (maximum of 255 characters, including spaces)
To better serve biomedical applications, SciPy will enhance its large-scale optimization and linear algebra support, add essential statistics capabilities, improve developer documentation, maintain current features, and strengthen community engagement.

5. Amount Requested - Enter total budget amount requested in USD, including indirect costs; this number should be between $50k and $250k total costs and match total described in the Budget Description. Enter whole numbers only (no dollar signs, commas, or cents)

6. Abstract - Provide a short summary of the application (maximum of 250 words)

SciPy is a Python library that provides fundamental building blocks for modeling and solving scientific problems. It is used worldwide for biomedical research and serves as a foundation for other essential open source tools. Developed almost entirely by volunteers for its two-decade history, a few gaps have surfaced that we will address with this project. We will:
* enhance SciPy's support for large-scale optimization and linear algebra;
* add essential methods for fitting statistical distributions to data; 
* improve the developer documentation to preserve hard-earned wisdom of seasoned maintainers;
* hold monthly meetings to make decisions on longstanding issues, support new contributors, and engage with the SciPy community;
* host "office hours" to provide technical support to SciPy users; 
* forge connections with users and other projects by offering tutorials, hosting sprints, and delivering talks; and
* reinforce SciPy's foundations by addressing its oldest issues and pull requests.
This project will leave SciPy strong and prepared for another twenty years of volunteer driven development.
