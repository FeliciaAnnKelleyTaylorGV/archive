8. Short Description of Project:
SciPy is a library of numerical routines for the Python programming language that provides fundamental building blocks for modeling and solving scientific problems.  SciPy includes algorithms for optimization, statistical analysis, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, differential equations, fast Fourier transforms and many other classes of problems; it also provides specialized data structures, such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.

SciPy is built on top of NumPy, which provides array data structures and related fast numerical routines, and SciPy is itself the foundation on which higher level scientific libraries, including scikit-learn and scikit-image, are built.

Project Metrics: Impact
Providing metrics is optional and metrics can be approximate.​ For each
metric, provide a source, clarify how the metric was computed and/or provide
any other comments. For monthly metrics, provide data from the most recent
month for which the corresponding metric is available.

Nature.com (nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0686-2/metrics) reports 98k article accesses and that the article is in the 99th percentile (ranked 416th) of the 337,379 tracked articles of a similar age in all journals and the 98th percentile (ranked 2nd) of the 86 tracked articles of a similar age in Nature Methods


1.2 - Monthly users, if applicable
Number: 5,000,000
Comment:
Our estimate of monthly users is based on the number of monthly downloads from package managers.
According to Conda Package Download Data (https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-package-data, the number of SciPy downloads from the "anaconda" and "conda-forge" channels of conda was 2,872,374 in March, 2021, an 80% increase since June 2020.
According to https://pypistats.org/packages/scipy, there were 29,124,271 downloads from PyPI between 3/28/21 and 4/28/21.

# conda (channel "anaconda") in June 2020: 1,083,916 /mo
# conda (channel "conda-forge") in June 2020: 503,660 /mo
# PyPI: on 7/10/2020, https://pypistats.org/packages/scipy reported 20,317,304 downloads last month)

On 4/28/2021, GitHub reported 319,805 dependent repositories (55% more than on 7/10/2020 and 175% more than on 7/25/2019) and 10,522 dependent packages (37% more than on 7/10/2020, and 114% more than on 7/25/2019); these numbers appear to be growing exponentially at a rate of over 50% per year. The most current data can be found at https://github.com/scipy/scipy/network/dependents. Among these dependencies are many important bio-specific packages like CellProfiler (https://cellprofiler.org/), biopython (https://biopython.org/), MNE (https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python), kindred (https://github.com/jakelever/kindred), Qiita (https://github.com/biocore/qiita), scikit-bio (http://scikit-bio.org/), and many of QIIME2's plugins (https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/).
