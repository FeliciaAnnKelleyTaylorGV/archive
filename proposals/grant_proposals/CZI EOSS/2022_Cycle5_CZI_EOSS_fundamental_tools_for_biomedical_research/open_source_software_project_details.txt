Yes

Short description of software project (200 words maximum) (required)
SciPy is a library of numerical routines for the Python programming language that provides fundamental building blocks for modeling and solving scientific problems. SciPy includes algorithms for optimization, statistical analysis, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, differential equations, fast Fourier transforms and many other classes of problems; it also provides specialized data structures, such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.

SciPy is built on top of NumPy, which provides array data structures and related fast numerical routines, and SciPy is itself the foundation on which higher level scientific libraries, including scikit-learn and scikit-image, are built.
